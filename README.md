## What is xLearn?

xLearn is a ***high performance***, ***easy-to-use***, and ***scalable*** machine learning package, 
which can be used to solve large-scale classification and regression problems. If you are the user 
of liblinear, libfm, or libffm, now the xLearn is your another better choice.

### Performance

xLearn is developed in high-performance C++ with careful design and optimization. Our system is designed to 
maximize CPU and memory utilizations, provide cache-aware computation, and support lock-free learning. By 
combining these insights, xLearn is 5x - 13x faster compared to the similar learning systems.
