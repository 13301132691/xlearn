For now, the xLearn can support Linux and Mac osx. This page gives instructions on how to build and install the xLearn package from source code. It consists of two steps:

 1. First build the executable file (***xlearn_train*** and ***xlearn_predict***) and shared library (libxlearn.so for Linux and libxlearn.dylib for Mac osx) from the C++ codes.
 2. Then install the python package.
